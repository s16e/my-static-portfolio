        <p>
         <div class="my"> Hi! I’m <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bolt">Subash Chandra Bose R</span>, a final-year B.Tech student
          majoring in Information Science and Engineering at
          <span style="font-weight:bold">St. Joseph's college of Engineering</span>, Bangalore. I’m passionate about building
          clean, responsive web applications and combining technology with
          creativity to solve real-world problems.</div> <div class="my">My strengths lie in
          full-stack development, UI/UX design, and Javascript programming. I’m
          currently learning <span style="font-weight:bold">React</span> and practicing
          <span style="font-weight:bold">DSA</span> to crack top tech interviews. Beyond tech, I have a
          creative side — I’ve worked as a freelance graphic designer on Fiverr
          and collaborated with brands as a content creator, leading teams and
          managing digital campaigns.</div>  <div class="my">I’m actively involved in hackathons, tech
          events, and coding contests. I also love exploring AI prompt
          engineering, staying up-to-date with new tools, and engaging with
          developer communities.</div>  <div class="my">Whether it’s designing intuitive user
          interfaces or automating backend logic, I believe in building projects
          that are both functional and delightful to use. I'm always eager to
          collaborate, learn, and take on exciting challenges!</div>
